    "1) San Diego Union Tribune: \"San Diego must acknowledge racial bias in police stops, leaders say\"\n",
    "- From late 2016, the article articulates that data from vehicle stops shows racial bias within San Diego's police department, specially towards Hispanic and Black individuals. It utlines the need for the police to acknowledge this and begin fighting against it. These claims, although not directly supported by data analysis in this article, makes us believe that racial bias still exists. This is important because the issue is recent and we hypothesise still present, we want to know if these protests and efforts have truly changed or minimized the bias within the San Diego police department.We would also like to expand beyond this and specifically determine which areas are more likely to present this issue. \n",

This article outlines some important aspects about ethics and claims thay we need to keep in mind when working on the resulting data of the project. If our hypothesis is correct and a bias is found, we need to keep in mind the causes of this. We cannot immediately assume that this bias is intentional, and like mentioned before, we need to keep in mind the location of the stops. If an area mostly resides Hispanic individuals, the fact that more Hispanics than white individuals are stopped does not mean a bias exists. \n",

    "*Data Cleaning*\n",
    "A first look at the vehicle stops data shows that NaNs exist as well as empty lines, but for the most part it is very clean and well organized. For example, when a vehicle search is not made, we can expect a \"\" in the 'contraband_found' section. Sometimes the age and race are missing, but these are only a few cases and since we cannot guess those values, they will be deleted. When it coems to unknown information such as as location of the stop, we can stil use those datapoints for more general, not location-specific claims, however when we dive into looking at the different areas of San Diego, we must not take these points into consideration as we cannon guess where the stop took place.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Data Analysis*\n",
    "After cleaning the first and second datasets we must merge them using their shared column 'stop_id'. Once this is done we can isolate vehicle stops based on different factors, that is, have a dataframe for each race, then each age group (increments of 10 yrs), and gender. Then we can analyze, by percentages, the decisions policemen take based on these factors. For example we might look at wheter males are more likely to be given only a verbal warning than males, of if Hispanic individuals are more likely to be searched than asian individuals. \n",
    "After this we can then look into the results of such searches, which age group/gender/race is more likely to carry contraband when searched, does this match the likelihood of that specific group being searched?\n",
    "The next part of the peoject involves merging location into this. The police department offers information about police areas, which can be matched to zip codes. The data found in city-data.com will need to be web scraped so we can attain the age, gender and race percentages of the areas where these stops are taking place. Then we can compare the values previously found to the population percentages and analyze if what might seem like racial bias happens because that race is more predominant to drive around a certain area. \n",
    "\n",
    "*What to report*\n",
    "We plan to report the findings based on age, gender, and race, adjusted based on population information. We plan to report if a specific group is statisticlly more likely to be searched, cited, given a verbal warning etc. We also plan to incorporte the location of these stops and graph (in a map), the trends we find on each specific area, this ay not only provide useful information for drivers, but also for the police departent as some areas might be more observed than others, or some areas might show a greater gender/age/gender bias than others.\n",

    "- city-data does not provide information of 5 out of the 28 zip codes in San Diego, so the part of our analysis that is based on location of the stoppings will not take the datapoints relating to these areas into account.\n",
    "- We do not know exactly how city-data conducts their studies and if any bias might be in place, but we beieve it is fair to assume that the data was colected faily, and does not leave out any information that would alter our results. \n",
    "- We believe that based on our data and the way we are going to use it, there are no further issues concerning privacy or equitable analysis that would impact our data analysis. \n",
    "- Through planning ahead and discussing our work before completing it, if we do encounter any issues we will be able to fix them before it being too late. We will always keep privacy and validity/biases a primary concern and ensure that eveything we do complies with the ethics of data science."

    "The results of our project would test police bias in San Diego. Issues such as police brutality have existed in the United States for many decades and reappeared recently during the BlackLivesMatter movement. Associating increased stops in particular zip codes of particular races suggests that there remains a bias in police officers on stereotypical criminals. If particular low-income zip codes have an increased amount of stops with very few actual findings (drugs, weapons, smuggling), it could mean that police are not stopping drivers out of safety but rather out of some sort of prejudice. \n",
    "\n",
    "If our hypothesis is false, then it means that police implicit bias training have been effective in limiting racial segregation. It would suggest that police stopping and searching in San Diego are not associated to preexisting suspicions or abusing their power. If we suspect that our method didn't work, then we will consider looking into previous years to see if there is a pattern that we have not found. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because of how independent police stops and searches are from one another, various local news and events can drastically confound our results. Local and global events and holidays can spike police stops on certain days more than others. Fear of national threat would also increase stops with an intent of protecting citizens. Having data from previous years allows us to mitigate pitfalls in our method but it does not change the fact that our assumptions may be misinformed. Lastly, it would also be important to consider the location of San Diego, given that the proximity to Mexico greatly increases police stops in the South to scan for illegal immigrants, which may also appear as a trend in our analysis.\n"
